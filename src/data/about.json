	"objective": "<p> I entered software engineering at the top of the abstraction stack. Frontend web development was my gateway drug. I quickly went down the rabbit hole. Next stop was backend web development. Throughout, I was deeply interested in the interfaces between my code and the hardware running it on one end and my code and the human consuming it on the other. </p> <p> Today I design, implement and scale platforms built on Node, TypeScript, Clojure, Go, Postgres, and whatever architecture suits the problem space - be it a monolith, microservices, or serverless. </p> <p> There are more things in the world that I do not know than things that I do know. I most prize my ability to learn, adapt, and live a good life in the meantime. </p>"
